# Building a Enterprise Network

## Objective

To design and implement a robust, scalable, and secure enterprise network that meets the organization's needs for reliable connectivity, data security, and efficient communication. This involves creating a comprehensive network architecture, configuring network devices, implementing security protocols, and ensuring optimal performance and redundancy across all network segments.

### Skills Learned

- Designing and planning the network topology, including the layout of routers, switches, firewalls, and other network devices.
- Ensuring scalability, redundancy, and performance optimization.
- Configuring network devices such as routers, switches, firewalls, and access points.
- Implementing VLANs, subnets, and secure routing protocols.
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.

## Steps

Example below.

Phase 1: This phase included building the first part of our network which consisted of 2 access switches, 
a distribution switch, and 5 PCs as seen in "Reference #1". After connecting all necessary ports and inputting the proper IP addresses, I configured trunking on all switches for VLAN 10 (Sales) and VLAN 20 (Finance). The last part of this phase was configuring VLAN access ports on switch 0 & 1. In Gif #1 it shows a ping from
